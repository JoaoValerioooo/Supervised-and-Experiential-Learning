# Supervised-and-Experiential-Learning

The course shows in detail two kind of Machine Learning techniques. The first part is devoted to Supervised Learning, and the second one to Experiential Learning. In the first part of the course the principles and challenges of Supervised Machine Learning will be analysed. Different kind of classification techniques (Bayesian, rule-based and statistical) will be studied. Also linear regression models will be explained. The use of diverse classification techniques will be analysed, and some methods will be detailed (random forests, etc.). Finally, some advanced topics in classification techniques will be discussed.Regarding the second part of the course, the basic components of the CBR reasoning cycle will be carefully studied and analysed. The application of CBR to the real world will be reviewed, and main problems the deployment of CBR application will be outlined.
